* Data Visualization: Creates bar charts for the top countries by total medal counts.
* SQL Analysis: Provides SQL queries to explore further insights into medal distribution by country and sport.

## Files
* data_processing.py: Contains functions for loading and processing the data using Pandas and NumPy.
* data_visualization.py: Contains functions for visualizing the country-specific performance.
* data_analysis.sql: Includes SQL queries for in-depth data analysis.
* main.py: The main script to load, process, visualize, and analyze the data.
